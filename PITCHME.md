### Toolkit demo #1 – deploy ARM template with Azure portal GUI

Showcase by using only Azure portal GUI:
* Create XX resource manually
* Delete XX resource
* Create XX resource with ARM template
  * Pick your choice, toolkit is wide (PowerShell, Visual Studio Code etc.)
  * Easiest to get started: Azure portal, no ”extra” tools needed on your workstation, anybody can try
